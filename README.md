# KSSM - Yet Another Mesh network Simulator 
## ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Kolejny Symulator Sieci Mesh

KSSM is yet another mesh network simulator, but its goal is to demonstrate how mesh networks work. KSSM tries to imitate LoRa mesh networks, especially the [Meshtastic network](https://meshtastic.org/).

Why another simulator? Because I can :-)

This is a very early version. Many features are not well thought out yet. It may (or may not) evolve over time.

## Currently working features and their limitations
- Nodes can be of two different types: *BasicMeshNode* and *MeshtasticNode*. *BasicMeshNode* is a simple kind of mesh node that can send text messages and relay messages from others. *MeshtasticNode* implements *managed flood routing* like in Meshtastic network;
- Basic nodes have only one mode: BASIC NODE;
- For the moment, you should create scenarios with nodes of the same type and with the same radio parameters;
- Meshtastic nodes can work in modes: CLIENT, CLIENT_MUTE, CLIENT_HIDDEN, ROUTER, ROUTER_CLIENT (although it is deprecated), REPEATER, ROUTER_LATE; all other modes will work as a CLIENT;
- Nodes can work in one of these presets: LONG_FAST, LONG_SLOW, VERY_LONG_SLOW (despite it is deprecated), MEDIUM_SLOW, MEDIUM_FAST, SHORT_SLOW, SHORT_FAST, LONG_MODERATE, SHORT_TURBO;
- Nodes generate messages with very random length;
- CSMA/CA algorithm, based on values used by real Meshtastic nodes;
- The best possible time resolution is 1 Âµs, the default time resolution is 1 ms;
- Simple collision detection;
- Very simple propagation model;
- Station "range" is calculated with processing gain, so different Modem Presets result in different range;
- Output results: charts and nodes' states visualization (png), network state animation (mp4), nodes' states and message list (csv), organized in html.

## Requirements
- ffmpeg,
- python 3.7+,
- numpy, matplotlib, pandas.

## Metrics explained
The KSSM calculates some metrics that describe network parameters. These metrics are presented in plots and stored in CSV files. The metrics are:
1. *air_util* - the percentage of the time the node was in one of these states: RX_BUSY and TX_BUSY; in other words this is the percentage of the time the medium was busy;
2. *tx_util* - the percentage of the time that the node was transmitting (TX_BUSY state);
3. *Number of known nodes* - the number of unique source node_ids registered in received frames;
4. *Number of messages heard* - the number of unique messages the node received;
5. *Normalized success rate* - this metric is calculated as 
$$normalized\\_success\\_rate = \frac{confirmed\\_messages}{tx\\_origin \cdot (number\\_of\\_nodes - 1)}$$
When the node successfully receives the message for the first time, the source's *confirmed_messages* metrics is incremented. Every message can be confirmed by all nodes (except the source node) in the map.
6.  *rx_success* - number of successfully completed receptions, this metric counts every received message (echos of our own, duplicates);
7.  *rx_fail* - number of times the reception failed because of collision;
8.  *rx_dups* - number of received duplicated messages;
9.  *rx_unicast* - number of received messages that the node was the destination;
10.  *tx_origin* - number of messages the node was the source;
11.  *tx_done* - number of times the node was transmitting messages (own or relayed);
12.  *forwarded* - number of messages that were forwarded by the node (the node was not the origin);
13.  *collisions_caused* - number of collisions caused by the node's transmission activity, collisions are counted for every node affected by the collision;
14.  *tx_cancelled* - number of times the node cancelled relaying, despite the fact the node was originally intended to relay, but heard another copy of this message (only *meshtastic* nodes);
15.  *tx_time_sum* - the cumulative time the node spent in TX_BUSY state;
16.  *rx_time_sum* - the cumulative time the node spent in RX_BUSY state;
17.  *backoff_time_sum* - the cumulative time the node spent in WAITING_FOR_TX state;

Plots of the success rate for every node are also available. For each inspected node, the number of received messages originating from it is displayed for every other node. For every received message, the number of hops is also registered, and an average *hops away* metric is calculated.

## Some details explained
### tx_time calculation
The time needed to transmit a message over LoRa is calculated with the method published in [Lora Modem Designer's Guide](https://github.com/meshtastic/meshtastic/blob/master/static/documents/LoRa_Design_Guide.pdf) and [Meshtastic source code](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/blob/1e4a0134e6ed6d455e54cd21f64232389280781b/src/mesh/RadioInterface.cpp#L201).
The symbol time is calculated with the formula $$symbol\\_time = \frac{2^{SF}}{BW}$$
Symbol time for some modem presets:
- *LONG_FAST* (SF = 11, BW = 250000 Hz) - symbol_time = 8192 Âµs
- *MEDIUM_FAST* (SF = 9, BW = 250000 Hz) - symbol_time = 2048 Âµs
- *SHORT_FAST* (SF = 7, BW = 250000 Hz) - symbol_time = 512 Âµs
- *VERY_LONG_SLOW* (SF = 12, BW = 62500 Hz) - symbol_time = 65536 Âµs
- *SHORT_TURBO* (SF = 7, BW = 500000 HZ) - symbol_time = 256 Âµs

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) calculation
This is simplified, as there is no need to simulate the hardware and the entire communication channel. The SNR is calculated with the formula: $$SNR = P_{signal} - P_{noise}$$ where $$P_{signal}$$ is the RSSI of the signal (dBm) and $$P_{noise}$$ is the power of the background noise (dBm). The RSSI is calculated with simple propagation model. The background noise level (power) is just a parameter of the node (default: -100 dBm). The background noise level is constant during the simulation (it may change in future). When $$SNR > -1 \cdot PG$$ (PG - *processing gain*), then it is considered as "*station in range*".

### Processing gain
Different LoRa settings result in different "range". For the same antennas and the same tx_power we can have further range by changing SF (*Spreading Factor*) and CR (*Coding Rate*) parameters in exchange for longer time needed for the transmission.

The *processing gain* (PG) is calculated as:

$$PG = 10 \cdot log_{10}(\frac{2^{SF}}{SF}) - 10 \cdot log_{10}(\frac{CR}{4})$$

where:
- SF is the Spreading Factor (7 to 12),
- CR is the cumulative number of bits used to code 4 information bits (from 5 to 8).

### Backoff time calculation (Meshtastic nodes)
Backoff time (contention window) is the random amount of time a station waits before a transmission starts. This time is calculated in a few different ways. The important values are:
- CWmin = 3
- CWmax = 8
- $$slot\\_time = 2.5 \cdot symbol\\_time + 7.6\cdot 10^{-3}$$
#### For messages originating from the node
To calculate the backoff time in this case we need to know the current *air utilization* - the percentage of time the medium was used (we were transmitting or receiving). Then we need to "map" this percentage value (from 0 to 100) to the range <CWmin, CWmax>:

$$CWsize = \frac{airutil}{100} \cdot (CW_{max} - CW_{min}) + CW_{min}$$

The backoff time is the random value from the range $$<0, 2^{CWsize}>$$ multiplied by symbol_time:
$$backoff\\_time = random(0, 2^{CWsize}) \cdot symbol\\_time$$
#### For relayed messages
The backoff time for this case is calculated in two ways, depending the role of the relaying node. In both cases the backoff_time is related to SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) measured during receiving the message to be relayed. The SNR should be in range <-20, +10> and this value is mapped to the range <CWmin, CWmax>:

$$CWsize = \frac{SNR + 20}{30} \cdot (CW_{max} - CW_{min}) + CW_{min}$$

Then the backoff time is calculated as:
- for ROUTER and REPEATER: $$backoff\\_time = random(0, 2^{CWsize}) \cdot slot\\_time$$
- for CLIENT and ROUTER_LATE (if no duplicate message was received): $$backoff\\_time = 2 CWmax \cdot slot\\_time + random(0, 2^{CWsize}) \cdot slot\\_time$$
- for ROUTER_LATE when the message intended to relay was received more than once: $$backoff\\_time = 2CWmax \cdot slot\\_time + 2^{CWsize} \cdot slot\\_time$$

As you can see, the ROUTER and the REPEATER will retransmit the message earlier than CLIENT. In both cases, the station that received the message with lower SNR (we can assume it means the station was further from the source) will retransmit the message earlier.
### Message relay rules
- ROUTER or REPEATER: relays message always,
- CLIENT: will not relay the message if the message was heard at least two times (relayed by other stations),
- ROUTER_LATE: as client, but when message is heard at least twice it does not cancel the relay but delays the relay with the longest backoff time.
